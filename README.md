# cs-project_Oregon-trail

### High School AP Computer Science Term Project

This project is a simple recreation of the classic game **The Oregon Trail**, completed within two weeks.  

The game allowed players to:  
- Create a party of up to three people, each with unique names that are stored.  
- Purchase from three types of supplies: "Uber bots", "Food", and "Clothing", each useful for the journey.  
- Carry money from one town to the next, with later towns having higher prices.  
- Converse with locals in each town, with responses randomly chosen from a set of phrases.  
- While traveling on the trail, players could enter `stop` in the input prompt to perform various actions:  
  - Continue the journey  
  - Check the map (ASCII art representation)  
  - Check remaining resources  
- While the input line ran at the bottom, the screen refreshed to show stats like distance traveled, distance to next town, food remaining, date, and weather.  
- At the end of the journey, players had to cross a lake, choosing either to use a ferry or float across.  
  - Floating involved an animation where the player moved diagonally across a river, with a chance of wagon failure causing the loss of items.  

The project was made in **2023**, so some functions are **deprecated**, and the project no longer runs. However, all functionality can still be seen in the provided video `gameShowCase.mp4`. A separate video `Video_Explanation.mp4` explains the classes and their functionality.
